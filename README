UNDER THE HOOD
--------------

This is a Drupal 6/7 module for developers and designers, it encompasses some
tools I seem to recreate fairly often when working on Drupal sites.  Here is a
list of the tools and what I've used them for:

* Server Inspector Block
  - A block which shows the PHP server variables in an easier to read manner.
* Session Inspector Block
  - Another block that shows the PHP session variables.
* Drupal Variables Editing Block
  - This block shows the serialized drupal variables, the serialized versions
    can be edited and saved back into the variables table.
* Form POST Inspector
  - This block contains a button that redirects all forms on a page to an
    internal page that displays the data as a prettified array.
